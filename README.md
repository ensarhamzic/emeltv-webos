# EmelTV webOS App

EmelTV is a custom LG webOS application designed to deliver a fullscreen live HLS video stream via a simple and responsive interface.

The app features integration with `webOSServiceBridge` for system-level service calls and uses HLS.js to play `.m3u8` video streams reliably on supported webOS devices.

A minimal overlay with playback and audio controls is included, along with a start button to initiate playback, ensuring user interaction compliance on smart TVs.

This application is intended for use with the EmelTV live broadcast stream and serves as a lightweight foundation for IPTV-style deployments on LG webOS TVs.

A companion backend for stream management is available here: [EmelTV Backend](https://github.com/ensarhamzic/emeltv-webos-backend)
